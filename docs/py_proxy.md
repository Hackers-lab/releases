# Net Split-Tunneler  v4.12

A Windows desktop tool for the messy reality of office networks: **share internet without losing the LAN**, **reach the intranet and the internet at the same time**, **flip between saved IP setups in one click**, and run a **full-featured LAN chat** between every PC on the network — all without any server, cloud account, or router config.

Windows 10/11 · Python 3.10+ · PyQt6

> [!NOTE]
> Most features just work as a normal user. The actions that change Windows
> networking (routes, secondary IP, switching adapter settings) ask for a
> one-time **UAC / administrator** approval when you click them.

## The main window — chat first

The app opens straight into **LAN Chat**. A header menu (⋮) gives you access to Network Tools, Settings, updates and more without leaving chat. The Network Tools window (proxy, routing, IP switch) opens on demand via that menu or the system tray.

### Network Tools — four tabs

| Tab | What it's for |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Host Mode** | This PC shares its internet to other PCs and keeps LAN access local |
| 🔗 **Client Mode** | This PC borrows another PC's internet over the LAN |
| 🌐 **Dual Access** | Use the corporate intranet **and** the internet at the same time, on one cable |
| 🔀 **IP Switch** | Save up to 4 network setups and switch between them with one click |

## Split-Tunneler

The core problem this solves: you're on a VPN or restricted hotspot on one PC, and you want other PCs on the same desk (or same room) to share that internet — but you still need them to reach printers, NAS drives, and intranet sites on the local network.

Standard internet-sharing breaks LAN access. Net Split-Tunneler doesn't.

**How it works:**

- The **Host PC** runs a proxy and also sets up a split-tunnel route on itself — internet traffic goes out through its VPN/hotspot, local subnet traffic (`10.x`, `172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`) stays on the LAN.
- **Client PCs** point their system proxy at the Host. Their browsers and apps get internet, and local network access is unaffected because their own routes are untouched.
- Discovery is automatic — clients find the Host by UDP broadcast on the same subnet. No IP typing required.

**Host setup:**
1. Open the app → **Host Mode**
2. Click **▶ Enable LAN+NET** — installs the split route
3. Click **▶ Start Proxy Server** — starts the HTTP/HTTPS proxy
4. Note your **Intranet IP** (shown in the app) and share it with clients if needed

**Client setup:**
1. Open the app → **Client Mode**
2. The Host is found automatically; its IP appears in **Host IP**
   (or type it manually if cross-subnet)
3. Optionally enable **Disable proxy if host unreachable** — your system falls back to direct when the Host goes offline
4. Click **⬡ Connect to Host Proxy** — done

---

## Proxy Sharing

The proxy server is a standard HTTP/HTTPS tunnel (CONNECT method), compatible with every browser and most apps without extra configuration. It listens on your LAN IP so only peers on the same network can connect — no open internet exposure.

- Automatically discovered by Client PCs on the same subnet
- Works with VPN, mobile hotspot, or any internet source on the Host
- The **Network traffic monitor** shows live download/upload speeds for the proxy connection
- **Show Speed in Taskbar** pins a live speed pill next to the clock, visible even when the main window is hidden

## Dual Access — intranet *and* internet at once

The everyday office problem: your desk cable gives you the **corporate intranet** (a `10.x` address, internal sites, SAP/ERP, file servers) but **no internet** — or a Wi-Fi/hotspot gives you internet but cuts you off from the intranet. Normally you switch back and forth all day.

**Dual Access gives you both at the same time, over the same network adapter.**

In one click it:
- Adds a second **internet IP** to your adapter (alongside your intranet IP)
- Sends internet traffic out the internet gateway, and keeps intranet traffic (`10.0.0.0/8`) on the corporate network — adding the intranet route automatically if it isn't there
- Sets up **split DNS** so internal hostnames (e.g. `*.yourcompany.in`) resolve through the corporate DNS servers, while everything else uses public DNS

**How to use it:**
1. Open **Dual Access**
2. The **Internet IP** is auto-filled from your adapter's saved DHCP address — or click **Auto** to detect it, or type it in
3. (Optional) Adjust the **NRPT Domains** — the internal domains that should resolve via corporate DNS. Your intranet DNS servers are read automatically from the adapter.
4. Click **▶ Enable Dual Access** and approve the UAC prompt

The four status rows (Intranet Route, Secondary IP, Internet Route, Split DNS) turn green as each piece comes up. Once it's on, the button switches to **Disable** — and it stays correct if you close and reopen the app while dual access is still active. If you enable again with a *different* Internet IP, the old address is removed first so they don't stack up. **Disable** reverses everything and restores your adapter (including your original DNS) to its previous state.

## IP Switch — saved network profiles, one click

If you regularly move a laptop between networks — office static IP, home DHCP, a lab subnet, a client site — IP Switch saves each setup and lets you apply it instantly instead of digging through Windows adapter settings.

- **Four profile buttons.** Each shows your chosen name and a status icon: **green ■** when that profile is currently active, **▶** when it's ready to apply. Click a button to switch.
- **Configure once.** Click **⚙ Configure Profiles** to open a tabbed editor (Profile 1–4). For each profile set:
  - **Name** — what the button shows (e.g. "Office Intranet", "Home Wi-Fi")
  - **Network Adapter** — picked from the adapters on this PC
  - **Address Mode** — a **Static / Auto (DHCP)** toggle. Choose **Auto** and Windows obtains everything automatically (the IP fields disappear); choose **Static** and fill in IP, subnet mask, gateway and DNS.
- Applying a profile asks for a one-time UAC approval, then reconfigures the adapter in seconds.

## LAN Chat

Click **💬 LAN Chat** to open the chat window. Every PC running the app on the same subnet is discovered automatically via UDP presence broadcast — no accounts, no server, no config.

### Conversations

**Private chat** — click any peer in the list to open a 1-on-1 conversation. Messages are stored locally and restored on restart.

**Groups** (＋ New → Group):
- Any user can create a group and becomes its first admin
- Admins can add or remove members, promote or demote other admins, and rename the group
- Removing the last admin automatically promotes the next member — a group can never be admin-less
- Removed members lose the group from their list immediately
- The creator can delete the group entirely; ownership transfers to another member first

**Broadcast channels** (＋ New → Channel):
- Only channel admins can post; members read only
- Useful for announcements or one-way updates to the whole team

### Messaging

- **Enter** sends · **Shift+Enter** inserts a new line
- **Reply** to any message (↩ Reply) — the quoted snippet appears inside the bubble
- **Reactions** — right-click any message to react with an emoji (👍 ❤️ 😂 😮 😢 🙏)
- **Forward** a message to another peer or group
- **Delete for everyone** — within 3 minutes of sending; the bubble becomes a tombstone on both sides
- **Delete for me** — removes a message from your local view only
- **Typing indicators** — shows who is typing in real time
- **Read receipts** — grey single tick (sent), grey double tick (delivered), **green** double tick (read); group messages show a "X/Y Seen" count

### File Transfer

- Click **📎** to attach a file to any 1-on-1 chat
- The recipient sees an accept/reject prompt; both sides show a live progress bar with percentage, speed, and ETA
- Images show as a clickable thumbnail
- Cancelling a transfer removes the partial file on the receiver's side
- Completed and cancelled transfers stay in the chat history

### Offline Delivery

If a peer is offline when you send, the message is held in a local queue and delivered automatically when they come back online. Queued messages show a **🕓** clock tick. Messages are best-effort — the queue is cleared if you quit before they reconnect.

### Search

Click **🔍** in the chat header to search across all your message text and file names in one place.

### Blocking

Right-click any peer in the roster to **Block** them. Blocked peers cannot send you messages or file offers — the drop happens silently at the network level, on LAN and cross-subnet alike. Unblock anytime from **Settings → Privacy & Users**.

### Notifications

Each chat type (Private, Group, Broadcast) has its own set of toggles:

| Toggle | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Sound** | Plays a soft two-note chime |
| **Show window** | Raises the chat window when it's hidden or minimised (badge in roster tells you who sent; no chat-switch) |
| **Taskbar flash** | Flashes the taskbar button |

When **Show window** is off (or the window is already visible), a **bottom-right toast** appears for background messages instead. Clicking the toast jumps to that conversation.

Global controls: **master on/off**, **Do Not Disturb**, **Mute all sounds**, and a **volume slider**.

### Connect by IP (cross-subnet)

Automatic discovery only spans one subnet. To reach a peer on a different network segment, enter their IP in **Connect by IP** and press ➤. The app probes port `54323`; the peer becomes available the moment their app is running.

## Remote Screen — view & control a PC

A lightweight, built-in remote desktop — no AnyDesk, VNC or TeamViewer needed, and no extra download (it reuses the same Qt the app already ships, so it adds almost nothing to the size).

**Start a session:** open a 1:1 chat and click the **🖥** button in the conversation header. A window opens showing the peer's screen. By default the peer is **asked to approve** the connection; once they click **Allow**, you can:

- **Move and click** the mouse (left / right / middle, scroll wheel)
- **Type** with your keyboard, including shortcuts like Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V
- **Sync the clipboard** — push your clipboard text to the remote PC with one button
- **Send Ctrl+Alt+End** (the remote equivalent of Ctrl+Alt+Del)
- Toggle **Control: on/off** to switch between controlling and view-only

You can also connect to a manual IP. The host listens on TCP `54325`.

**While you're being viewed**, a red "*X is viewing your screen*" banner stays on top of your screen with a **Stop** button so a session can never run silently.

**Unattended access (optional):** in **Settings → Remote Screen** you can set a **secret** and enable *connect without asking*. A peer who presents that secret is let in automatically, with no approval prompt — handy for your own machines.

> [!WARNING]
> Unattended access is effectively a backdoor: anyone with the secret can control the PC without approval. It is **off by default**. Only enable it with a long, unique secret shared only with devices you trust.

**Readable text:** by default the host sends **lossless PNG** frames at its **native resolution**, so small text and icon labels stay crisp — no JPEG smearing or downscaling. This is the *Sharp text mode* toggle in **Settings → Remote Screen**; on a slow link you can turn it off to fall back to (lighter) JPEG and pick a lower **Resolution**.

Performance is tunable in Settings (sharp-text mode, resolution, image quality, frame rate). On a LAN it's smooth enough for clicking, typing and copy-paste; over the internet, lower the resolution or turn off sharp-text mode and expect more lag.

---

## Settings

Open Settings from the **⚙** gear next to *YOU* in the chat sidebar. Changes take effect on **Save**; **Cancel** discards everything.

| Page | What you configure |
|---|---|
| **General** | Display name, invisible mode (appear offline), start with Windows, minimise to tray, restore last session on open |
| **Notifications** | Master switch, DND, mute all, volume slider; per-type (Private / Group / Broadcast) toggles for Sound, Show window, Taskbar flash |
| **Storage** | Message retention (7 / 30 / 90 / 180 days or forever), download folder, max file transfer size, usage stats, clear all history |
| **Network** | Active interfaces, IPs, ports in use, peers currently online, queued offline messages |
| **Privacy & Users** | Blocked peer list with instant Unblock |
| **File Transfer** | Download folder, max file size, offer expiry time |
| **Remote Screen** | Allow incoming sessions, unattended secret, sharp-text (lossless) mode, resolution, image quality, frame rate, approval timeout |
| **About** | Version, diagnostics |
