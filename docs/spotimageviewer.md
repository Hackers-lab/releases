## 🌟 Why SpotImageViewer?

In modern power utility operations, rapid access to visual meter records and authoritative consumer billing data is critical. SpotImageViewer eliminates folder browsing, disjointed spreadsheets, and manual web portal checks by delivering a unified, intelligent single-page desktop workspace:

- **Instant Visual Discovery:** Index, locate, and preview hundreds of thousands of spot meter photos in milliseconds.
- **Live w*****l Portal Connectivity:** Real-time Outstanding Dues (OSD) scraping and connection status checking right on your viewport.
- **Intelligent Assessment Tools:** Compute WBERC-compliant bills, perform dual-ledger theft assessments, and match records via batch fuzzy lookup.
- **Enterprise Ergonomics:** Modern glassmorphic interface powered by Microsoft Edge WebView2, featuring full Dark & Light mode persistence and VS Code-inspired tool rails.

## 🚀 Key Features & Capabilities

### 🔍 Smart Image Discovery & Inspection Viewport
SpotImageViewer indexes local and shared network drives using a high-performance SQLite engine with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) capable of handling millions of images.

- **Universal Search Engine:** Search instantly by **9-digit Consumer ID**, **Meter Number**, **Mobile Number**, or **Consumer Name** with built-in search history and quick recall.
- **Interactive Inspection Canvas:** Smooth mouse-wheel zoom (up to 500%), click-and-drag panning, 90° rotation, image saving, and direct printing.
- **Timeline Organization:** Automatically organizes photos by reading cycle dates for quick historical trend comparisons.
- **Multi-Photo Overview Grid:** Switch to **Preview All Photos** grid mode to view all historical spot photos for a consumer simultaneously.
- **Photo Filmstrip Dock:** Symmetrical bottom filmstrip with collapsible reel and quick thumbnail navigation.

### ⚡ Live w*****l OSD & Portal HUD
Stay informed without leaving your workflow. The embedded floating HUD card queries live portal data in the background:
- **Connection Status:** Displays clean live status indicators (**Connected**, **Deemed**, **Disconnected**).
- **Outstanding Dues Breakdown:** Instant extraction of total dues, unpaid bill balance, and Late Payment Surcharge (LPSC).
- **Smart Office Location:** Automatically parses and standardizes office locations (stripping redundant CCC prefixes) with hover tooltip support.

### 🔍 Batch & Manual Fuzzy Matching Engine
Match field records, voter lists, or survey sheets against the utility meter mapping database using weighted token and string similarity algorithms.

- **Automated Fuzzy Matching:** Compare names and service addresses with configurable threshold scoring (0.00 – 1.00) and top-N candidate ranking.
- **Relative / Ancestor Recognition:** Detects family references (e.g., father, husband, S/O, W/O) for high-confidence identification.
- **1-Click Live OSD Verification:** Directly query live portal outstanding dues for matched candidates within the results table.
- **Interactive Ad-Hoc Lookup:** Test individual queries on the fly without uploading external files.
- **Excel Import & Export:** Process `.xlsx` spreadsheets and export matched candidate reports with complete audit trails.

- **Symmetrical Time-of-Day (TOD):** Normal, Peak, and Off-Peak consumption modeling.
- **Tiered Tariff Slabs:** Automated tiered energy charges and electricity duty (ED) calculations.
- **Government Relief & Subsidies:** Accurate pro-rata calculation of domestic lifelines and subsidy ceilings (≤ 300 units/month).
- **Comprehensive Surcharges & Rebates:** Phase-based meter rent, timely payment rebates, special rebates, and minimum charge protections.
