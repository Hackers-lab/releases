## 🚀 What's New in Version 10.1

* **⚡ Modern IEC 60617 DTR Symbol:** Standardized dual-coil transformer symbol with compact side squares for both new and existing DTRs.
* **🟥 Compact Red Square DP Structure:** High-visibility $11 \times 11\text{ px}$ square poles matching HT pole styling with balanced $28\text{ px}$ center distance.
* **🔄 Full Orientation Support:** Seamless Horizontal / Vertical alignment for new & existing DP/DTR with auto-rotating stays and center connections.
* **🏷️ Smart Label Clearance:** Dynamic positioning prevents labels from overlapping vertical structures, earthing, or stays.
* **🛡️ Dynamic Cradle Guard Iron & Stay Rendering:** Per-span bracket calculations and clean stay rendering behind pole bodies.

## 🔄 Previous Highlights (v9.4)

* **📅 Extended Validity:** App validity extended until 31.12.2026.

## 🔄 Previous Highlights (v9.3)

* **📐 Compact Footer Controls:** Shortened bottom-bar checkbox labels (Symbol, Ex Length, Mark, Legend) to maximize live estimate pane width.
* **🛡️ Antivirus Fix:** Disabled UPX compression to prevent false-positive AV detections.

## 🔄 Previous Highlights (v9.2)

* **🔧 DTR Augmentation Labour:** Automatic labour charges for dismantling & installing DTR during augmentation — rates by target capacity (≤25KVA ₹2,205 • 63KVA ₹2,665 • 100KVA ₹2,998 • 160KVA+ ₹5,087).
* **📦 Return DTR Codes:** Augmentation now adds the correct return-to-store material code for the old DTR, with a **"Return Condition"** selector: Defective (DAM1) or Use & Healthy (UH01).
* **🎨 DTR Code Painting Rate Fix:** Corrected from ₹65 to ₹60.
* **🛠 AB Cable Clamp Iron Fix:** Flat 65×6 requirement updated from 1 NOS to 2 NOS (0.5m each) per AB cable span.

## 🔄 Previous Highlights (v9.1)

* **⚡ 33kV HT Lines & Poles:** Full 33kV support with 3-letter pole prefixes (PLT/PHT/P33/ELT/EHT/E33).
* **👁 Drawing Declutter:** Toggle pole-height and span-length labels independently.
* **📅 Extended Validity:** App validity extended until 31.08.2026.

## 🔄 Previous Highlights (v8.1)

* **🔎 Estimate Transparency:** Right-click any line in the Live Estimate to trace exactly which objects and rules produced it.
* **⚠️ Rule Overlap Warning:** Save-time alerts for duplicate or overlapping rule conditions.
* **🏗️ Structure Extensions:** DP/TP/4P/DTR extensions now correctly add iron and erection labour.

## 🔄 Previous Highlights (v8.0)

* **📦 Windows Installer with Automatic Updates:** Ships as Setup.exe with Start-menu shortcut, checks GitHub for updates on launch.
* **🪶 Smaller, Faster Install:** Removed AI Rule Creator dependency, pruned unused Qt payload (~50% smaller download).
* **🛟 Startup Crash Log:** Full error written to `last_crash.log` if the app fails to start.

## ⚡ Core Features

### 1. Interactive Drawing Canvas
* **Smart Objects:** Drag and drop specialized elements like `SmartPole` (LT/HT), `SmartStructure` (DP, TP, 4P, DTR), and `SmartConsumer`.
* **Smart Connections:** Wire objects together using `SmartSpan`, which automatically calculates line lengths, voltage drops, and required hardware based on connected nodes.
* **Contextual Mapping:** Add underlying GPS maps and use custom drawing tools to plot roads, rail lines, and terrain limits alongside your electrical networks.
* **CAD Controls:** Smooth zooming, middle-mouse panning, and spacebar-drag navigation for a professional drafting experience.

### 2. Dynamic Rule Engine
* **Automated BOM & Labor:** Automatically evaluates the drawn canvas against a dynamic `rules.json` configuration file.
* **Advanced Logic Processing:** Granular calculations driven by our improved estimation logic compute exact material (BOM) and labor quantities, including complex structural iron weights and stay/earth requirements.

### 3. Professional Exports
* **Excel Estimates (`openpyxl`):** Generates detailed, multi-sheet workbooks complete with full standard estimates, granular "Iron Breakup" sheets, and live formulas that automatically recalculate when edited externally.
* **PDF Schematics:** Exports massive network drawings into multi-page PDFs with automatic page orientation and continuation markers.
* **Billing Packets:** Generates comprehensive billing PDF packets with invoice, SMB cover, abstract, completion certificate, consumption report, optional estimate, measurement sheets, and project drawings.
* **Billing Reports:** Landscape PDF summary of all invoiced projects with totals.

### 4. Built-in Database
* Powered by a robust SQLite backend containing the new official 2026 master material and labor codes/rates.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Python 3.x**
* **UI & Canvas:** PyQt6 (`QGraphicsScene` / `QGraphicsView`)
* **Data Export:** `openpyxl`, `QPrinter`
* **Database:** SQLite3
